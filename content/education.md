Throughout my time at Plainfield North High School I gained many valuable skills. The most important skill I learned was how to multi-task. I had to effectively divide my time between studies, sports, and a job. I had the opportunity to take three years of Computer Science. To take these classes I enrolled in summer school for 3 years.

Junior Year Computer Science Project
Built a web-based address book. Designed a MySQL database that resided on a Raspberry Pi accessed via a RESTful web service written in Java using JAX-RS that supported full CRUD. I was able to remotely accessed this from school to demonstrate. My teacher was so impressed he asked if he could use the source code for another project.

Senior Year Computer Science Project
Enhanced earlier project by adding AngularJS UI. All technologies were self-learned.

Courses Taken:

* Intro to Programming
* Intro to Java Honors
* AP Computer Science A
* AP Computer Science Principles
  
GPA: 4.96/5.00
