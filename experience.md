## Student Analyst - ITS Help Desk at The University of Iowa
I learned many valuables skills that will be able to help me in my future career. While at the ITS Help Desk, I continued my growth with communication with people in person, as well as over several communication methods like phone, email, and live chat. This job also helped me gain skills in troubleshooting issues, which will be a valuable skill in the workplace. During my short time here I have got a promotion from working only with phone support, to also helping with email and live chat.

## Cashier - Jewel-Osco
I learned many valuable skills while working at Jewel-Osco that will help me in my future career. Among them, I learned how to communicate with people, work effectively in a team environment, deal with adversity and interact with people in the real world. I started as a bagger and worked my way up to cashier. I was considered for a position at the service desk but because I was heading off to college the position went to someone else.
