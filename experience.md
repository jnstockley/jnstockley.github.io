## [Student Backup - ITS Help Desk at The University of Iowa](https://its.uiowa.edu/)
Throughout my time at the ITS Help Desk, I have learned and grown drastically. I started at as a Student Analyst and have been promoted several times up to Student Backup. I have learned how to work with our customers, over the phone, and in person. I have also gained the ability to work and interact with my co-workers in person and remotely. While at the ITS Help Desk I have been able to learn new tools, as well as new skills.

## [Cashier - Jewel-Osco](https://www.jewelosco.com/)
I learned many valuable skills while working at Jewel-Osco that will help me in my future career. Among them, I learned how to communicate with people, work effectively in a team environment, deal with adversity and interact with people in the real world. I started as a bagger and worked my way up to cashier. I was considered for a position at the service desk but because I was heading off to college the position went to someone else.
