# Experience

## Cashier - Jewel-Osco
I learned many valuable skills while working at Jewel-Osco that will help me in my future career. Among them, I learned how to communicate with people, work effectively in a team environment, deal with adversity and interact with people in the real world. I started as a bagger and worked my way up to cashier. I was considered for a position at the service desk but because I was heading off to college the position went to someone else.

Throughout my time at Plainfield North High School I gained many valuable skills. The most important skill I learned was how to multi-task. I had to effectively divide my time between studies, sports and a job. I had the opportunity to take three years of Computer Science. In order to take these classes I enrolled in summer school for 3 years.
