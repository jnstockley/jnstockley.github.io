## [Student Analyst - ITS Help Desk at The University of Iowa](https://its.uiowa.edu/)
I learned many valuables skills that will be able to help me in my future career. While at the ITS Help Desk, I continued my growth with communication with people in person, as well as over several communication methods like phone, email, and live chat. This job also helped me gain skills in troubleshooting issues, which will be a valuable skill in the workplace. During my short time here I have got a promotion from working only with phone support, to also helping with email and live chat.

## [Vaccine Checker](https://github.com/jnstockley/Vaccine-Checker)
   This is a Java program that uses Selenium WebDriver to scrape [https://vaccinespotter.org](https://vaccinespotter.org) to see if a COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment is available based on data the user enters into a JSON config file. If the program finds a suitable appointment it will send the user an email, with a personalized link to see if the vaccine is available and then to book it.
   
## [BTTN (Better Twitch.tv Notifications)](https://github.com/jnstockley/BTTN)
   This is a Java program that uses [Twitch's API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) to determine if a channel is live. The user can add any number of channels, using the program, to a JSON 'config' file. Whenever the program is ran it will use the Twitch API to determine if the channel is live. If the status of the channel has changed from not live to live, using data stored in the JSON file, it will send the user a mobile push notification using [Spontit](https://spontit.com).
