Hello, I am Jack Stockley! I am an Undergraduate Student in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Iowa. I am currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a certificate in either Data Security or Big Data.

# Experience

## Cashier - Jewel-Osco
I learned many valuable skills while working at Jewel-Osco that will help me in my future career. Among them, I learned how to communicate with people, work effectively in a team environment, deal with adversity and interact with people in the real world. I started as a bagger and worked my way up to cashier. I was considered for a position at the service desk but because I was heading off to college the position went to someone else.
