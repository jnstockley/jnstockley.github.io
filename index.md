# [Projects](projects.md)
## [BTTN (Better Twitch.tv Notifications)](https://github.com/jnstockley/BTTN)
   This is a Java program that uses [Twitch's API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) to determine if a channel is live. The user can add any number of channels, using the program, to a JSON config file. Whenever the program is run it will use the Twitch API to determine if the channel is live. If the status of the channel has changed from not live to live, using data stored in the JSON file, it will send the user a mobile push notification using [Alertzy](https://alertzy.app).

## [Vaccine Checker](https://github.com/jnstockley/Vaccine-Checker)
   This is a Java program that uses Selenium WebDriver to scrape [https://vaccinespotter.org](https://vaccinespotter.org) to see if a COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment is available based on data the user enters into a JSON config file. If the program finds a suitable appointment it will send the user an email, with a personalized link to see if the vaccine is still available and then to book it.
