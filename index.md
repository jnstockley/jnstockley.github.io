## Welcome to jnstockley.github.io

My name is Jack Stockley. I have a love for computers and software. My first major project I have worked on is my [Address Book java program.](https://github.com/jnstockley/AddressBook) I also then made a second part of that program and impleted a RESTful API. I have called this program the [Address Book Rest](https://github.com/jnstockley/AddressBookREST), very creative I know. To learn more about these program scroll down. I am currently a high school student but am going to be starting my freshmen year at the Unviersity of Iowa as a Computer Science Major.
