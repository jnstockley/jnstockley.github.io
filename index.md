## [Student Analyst - ITS Help Desk at The University of Iowa](https://its.uiowa.edu/)
I learned many valuables skills that will be able to help me in my future career. While at the ITS Help Desk, I continued my growth with communication with people in person, as well as over several communication methods like phone, email, and live chat. This job also helped me gain skills in troubleshooting issues, which will be a valuable skill in the workplace. During my short time here I have got a promotion from working only with phone support, to also helping with email and live chat.

## [Vaccine-Checker](https://github.com/jnstockley/Vaccine-Checker)
   This is a Java program that uses Selenium WebDrive to scrap https://vaccinespotter.org to see if a COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment is available based on data the user enters into a JSON config file. If the program finds a suitable appointment it will send the user an email, with a personalized link to see if the vaccine is available and then to book it.
